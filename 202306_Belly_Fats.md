- Eat plenty of **soluble fiber**: fruits, vege, legumes, oats, barley
  - Soluble fiber may help you to lose weight by increasing fullness and reducing calorie absorption 
- Avoid foods that contain **trans fats**
 - Trans fats are created by pumping hydrogen into unsaturated fats, such as soybean oil 
 - Read ingredient labels carefully and stay away from products that contain trans fats
- Moderate your alcohol intake
  - Excess alcohol intake has been associated with increased belly fat 
- Eat a **high protein diet**: meat, fish, eggs, diary, bean, whey protein
  - High protein intake increases the release of the fullness hormone peptide YY
  - Which decreases appetite and promotes fullness 
- Reduce your stress levels
 - Stress hormone: Stress can make you gain belly fat by triggering the adrenal glands to produce cortisol
 - High cortisol levels increase appetite and drive abdominal fat storage  
- Don’t eat a lot of sugary foods - Excess sugar intake is a major cause of weight gain 
- Do aerobic exercise (**cardio**)
- Perform resistance training (**lift weights**)
- Cut back on carbs, especially **refined carbs**  
  - Replacing refined carbs with unprocessed starchy carbs may improve metabolic health and reduce belly fat

### 2) Cardio Training
