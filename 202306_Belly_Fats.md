[[source1]](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/20-tips-to-lose-belly-fat) Change your lifestyle and combine different methods:
- Eat plenty of **soluble fiber**: fruits, vege, legumes, oats, barley
  - Soluble fiber may help you to lose weight by increasing fullness and reducing calorie absorption 
- Avoid foods that contain **trans fats**
 - Trans fats are created by pumping hydrogen into unsaturated fats, such as soybean oil 
 - Read ingredient labels carefully and stay away from products that contain trans fats
- Moderate your alcohol intake
  - Excess alcohol intake has been associated with increased belly fat 
- Eat a **high protein diet**: meat, fish, eggs, diary, bean, whey protein
  - High protein intake increases the release of the fullness hormone peptide YY
  - Which decreases appetite and promotes fullness 
- Reduce your stress levels
 - Stress hormone: Stress can make you gain belly fat by triggering the adrenal glands to produce cortisol
 - High cortisol levels increase appetite and drive abdominal fat storage  
- Don’t eat a lot of sugary foods - Excess sugar intake is a major cause of weight gain 
- Do aerobic exercise (**cardio**)
- Perform resistance training (**lift weights**)
- Cut back on carbs, especially **refined carbs**  
  - Replacing refined carbs with unprocessed starchy carbs may improve metabolic health and reduce belly fat
- Limit sugar-sweetened beverages
 - Your brain doesn’t process liquid calories the same way it does solid ones 
 - You’re likely to end up consuming too many calories later on and storing them as fat
- Get plenty of restful sleep
  - Sleep deprivation is linked to an increased risk of weight gain 
- Track your food intake and exercise
  - If you’re looking to lose weight, it may help to keep track of what you’re eating
- Eat fatty fish every week
  - Omega-3 fats may also help reduce visceral fat 
  - Eating fatty fish or taking omega-3 supplements sourced from fish oil or algae may improve your overall health
- Limit consumption of fruit juice
  - Fruit juices contains as much sugar as soda and may contribute to weight gain
- Eat probiotic foods or take a probiotic supplement
  - beneficial gut bacteria may help promote weight loss
